# INLBreadcrumbs

## 1. Overview
The `INLBreadcrumbs` library adds breadcrumbs to a `UINavigationController`. You can pop to an arbitrary view controller from the title view.

## 2. How to use
There are two ways breadcrumbs can be added to your application:

#### 1: Subclassing INLBreadcrumbViewController
This is the simpler approach. All you need to do is subclass the `INLBreadcrumbViewController`. No further configuration needed.
```objective-c
#import "INLBreadcrumbs.h"

@interface MyViewController : INLBreadcrumbViewController
```
Congratulations. You have just added breadcrumbs to your application

#### 2: Implementing the INLBreadcrumbCompatibleController protocol
This approach requires you to write slightly more code but it‚Äôs more flexible since you don‚Äôt need to subclass anything.

First, implement the `INLBreadcrumbCompatibleController` protocol and create a breadcrumb property of type `INLBreadcrumb*`
```objective-c
#import "INLBreadcrumb.h"

@interface INLBreadcrumbViewController : UIViewController <INLBreadcrumbCompatibleController>
@property (strong, nonatomic) INLBreadcrumb * breadcrumb;
```
In the `+load` method and call the `setupBreadcrumbs` and in the `-viewDidLoad` initialise the breadcrumb property
```objective-c
#import "INLBreadcrumb.h"

@implementation INLBreadcrumbViewController

+(void)load {
	[super load];
	[self setupBreadcrumbs];
}

-(void)viewDidLoad {
	[super viewDidLoad];
	self.breadcrumb = [INLBreadcrumb breadcrumbWithController:self];
}
```

## 3. Multiple breadcrumb stacks
You can have multiple breadcrumb stacks e.g. if you have several `UITabViewController` tabs or a modal transition - each should have a separate breadcrumb stack. You associate a breadcrumb with a breadcrumb stack by specifying a manager when creating the breadcrumb.
```objective-c
[INLBreadcrumb breadcrumbWithController:self manager:[INLBreadcrumbManager managerForKey:@"stackId"]];
```
If you don‚Äôt specify a manager the default manager is used.

## 4. Customising the UI
You can change the breadcrumb indicator in the navigation bar title view (default is " ‚ñæ") and the cancel button title for the iPhone action sheet popup (default is ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù) by setting the corresponding properties.
```objective-c
self.breadcrumb.cancelButtonTitle = NSLocalizedString(@"breadcrumbs.cancel‚Äù, nil);
self.breadcrumb.breadcrumbIndicator = @" üçû";
```
This will only set the values for a specific breadcrumb. If you want to set it for an entire breadcrumb stack you can change the manager settings.
```objective-c
[INLBreadcrumbManager defaultManager].cancelButtonTitle = NSLocalizedString(@"breadcrumbs.cancel", nil);
[INLBreadcrumbManager defaultManager].breadcrumbIndicator = @" üçû";
```
Changing the manager settings will not affect breadcrumbs that were already created. You should therefore set this before initialising the first view controller that uses breadcrumbs.
